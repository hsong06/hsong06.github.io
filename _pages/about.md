This is Haohong Song. Thanks for visiting my personal websites

My name is Haohong Song(‚ôÇ). I graduated from the University of Science and Technology of China. My undergraduate major was polymer chemistry. My research focuses on computational materials chemistry, molecular dynamics simulations, atomic level modeling and catalyst systems. If you are interested in VASP, NequIP, Deep MD, you are welcome to discuss with me and we can learn from each other. In my free time, I enjoy running, travelling, and playing Leagues. I believe Interdisciplinary Materials science is the future of human development, and I'm looking forward to collaborating with you guys!üòÅ"
