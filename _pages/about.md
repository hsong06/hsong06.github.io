This is Haohong Song. Thanks for visiting my personal websites

My name is Haohong Song(‚ôÇ). I graduated from the University of Science and Technology of China. My undergraduate major was polymer chemistry. My research focuses on computational materials chemistry, molecular dynamics simulations, atomic level modeling and catalyst systems. Recently, my primary research interest lies in the realm of computational catalysis, focusing on the intricate dynamics and underlying mechanisms of catalytic processes across various scales - from monoatomic to diatomic and polyatomic systems. By delving deep into these systems, I aim to unveil the fundamental principles governing catalytic efficiency and selectivity, thereby paving the way for the design of more effective and sustainable catalytic materials and processes.

If you are interested in VASP, NequIP, Deep MD, you are welcome to discuss with me and we can learn from each other. In my free time, I enjoy running, travelling, and playing Leagues. I believe Interdisciplinary Materials science is the future of human development, and I'm looking forward to collaborating with you guys!üòÅ"
